# A React / TS Quiz App
> This is a React / Typescript application which allows the user to play a quiz with questions and answers provided by the Open Trivia API.



## General Information
- I undertook this project to gain experience in working with TypeScript
- In particular I was looking to get insights about working with TypeScript in a React Application (how to type functional components, props, state) and why it is beneficial to do so
- This application is based on a tutorial from Thomas Weibenfalk for freeCodeCamp. I took the basic logic and styling from the tutorial and made some adjustments to it (e.g. adding a message after the completion of the quiz to indicate success / failure depending on the final score)
- I also removed styled-components and worked with standard CSS instead to solidify my understanding of basic CSS



## Technologies Used
- React 17.0.2
- TypeScript 4.1.2



## Features
- Displaying a quiz with questions and answers
- Displaying a loading screen when data is retrieved from the API
- Displaying a score and a final result depending on success in answering the questions
